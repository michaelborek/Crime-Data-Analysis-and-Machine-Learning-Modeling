# Crime-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Modeling
This notebook demonstrates a complete analysis of the "Crime Data from 2020 to Present" dataset. The goal is to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and build machine learning models for classification and regression tasks.

Dataset was excluded from the Repository due to the large size, for its access: [Data.gov Catalog Entry](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present)
